<p><em><strong>SingStyle101</strong></em> is a large and high-quality singing dataset. It contains 101 songs performed by eight professional singers, spanning 12.8 hours of clean monophonic vocal recordings in studio quality.</p>
<p>It is a diverse dataset with creative singing. It covers English, Chinese, and Italian songs and incorporates various singing styles, such as bel canto opera, Chinese folk, pop, jazz, and children. Some performances are creative improvisations based on the original score.</p>
<p>It demonstrates style transfer in both performance and timbre levels. 77 songs contain at least two distinct singing styles performed by the same singer.</p>
<p>It includes proper annotations and extracted features. We manually segmented voices into phrases, aligned the phonemes of lyrics with Performance MIDI files and music score notes, and extracted acoustic features such as Mel-Spectrogram, F0 contour, and amplitude curves.</p>
<p>It applies to different MIR tasks such as SVS, SVC, Singing Transcription, Score Following, Expressive Performance, Lyrics Detection, and Singing Style Transfer.</p>

To ensure the confidentiality of the singers' personal information, the <em><strong>SingStyle101</strong></em> dataset will not be made public.<br>
However, to promote the adoption of the dataset, we will allow researchers to access and download the data free by application for only non-commercial, non-profit research purposes. We will review the applications accordingly to prevent potential cases of misuse and malicious spread, for which we ask for your understanding.<br>

There has been a persistent lack of publicly accessible data in singing voice research, particularly concerning the diversity of languages and performance styles. In this paper, we introduce SingStyle101, a large studio-quality singing dataset with multiple languages and different singing styles, and present singing style transfer examples. The dataset features 101 songs performed by eight professional singers, spanning 12.8 hours and covering English, Chinese, and Italian. <em><strong>SingStyle101</strong></em> incorporates different singing styles, such as bel canto opera, Chinese folk singing, pop, jazz, and children. Specifically, 77 songs include at least two distinct singing styles performed by the same singer. All recordings were conducted in professional studios, yielding clean, dry vocal tracks in mono format with a 44.1 kHz sample rate. We have segmented the singing voices into phrases, providing lyrics and scores with phoneme-level alignment. We also extracted acoustic features such as Mel-Spectrogram, F0 contour, and amplitude curves. This dataset applies to various MIR tasks such as Singing Voice Synthesis, Singing Voice Conversion,  Singing Transcription, Score Following, and Lyrics Detection. It is also designed for Singing Style Transfer, including both performance and timbre style. We will make the dataset freely available for research purposes.
